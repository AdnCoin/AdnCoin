AdnCoin [ADN]
ADN Objectif

The objective of ADNCOIN is therefore to make a human genome from scratch, by deciding "its writing", that is to say by creating and associating bases, the "letters" of DNA, in Controlling their combination, to edit a complete genome, ready to be inserted into a cell. According to the researchers, there are many applications, such as the production of virus-resistant or cancer-resistant cell lines, the creation of human organs for transplants, the production of vaccines or the development of drugs using human cells.

Scientists already know how to make short portions of DNA, but creating an entire human genome would still be very costly. The main objective of this new project is to seek to raise $ 100 million this year.

Some other scientists, such as the biologist Drew Endy of Stanford University, are worried. He believes that "before launching such a project with such enormous ethical implications it is necessary to ask the fundamental questions starting with knowing if and under what circumstances we should make these technologies a reality. He criticizes the fact that "the authors fail to ask these essential questions. In fact, in their proposal, they do not succeed in asking any questions. " The main ethical concern raised is the potential capacity to "create children without biological parents".

Recalling the important ethical debates raised by scientific revolutions in the field of genome engineering, such as CRISPR-Cas9, the authors acknowledge the importance and urgency of holding public consultations with all stakeholders.

These techniques are only at an experimental stage, but they remind us once again of the urgency of a worldwide awareness of the power of these new technologies. Ethical regulations are essential to prevent potential drift of these techniques, which may result in the creation of genetically modified embryos or developed with a genome created from scratch.
